# Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
# Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
# 1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
# 2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
# 3. 	Displays the result accordingly.

# num=int(input("enter the number:"))
# if num%2==0:
#     print(f"{num} is even")
# else:
#     print(f"{num} is odd")
#

# Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

for i in range(1,51):
    total+= i
print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is {total}")
