TASK 1:-The functionality of a multiple-arithmetic-operation program is to take input values from the user, allow them to choose an operation, and then apply the selected arithmetic operator on the given numbers. The program performs calculations automatically and displays the result. It helps automate mathematical computations and reduces manual calculations.
TASK 2:-he functionality of this program is to take the user’s first name and last name as input, join (concatenate) the two strings, and then display a greeting message using the combined full name. It demonstrates how string concatenation works in Python.
TASK 3: Decision-Making Using Conditional Statements
